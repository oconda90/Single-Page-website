# Single-Page-website
This is a sinlge page website about my journey as a Gamer.
I know it sounds silly yo make a website about this but i had no other ideas
I Put my css styles in a different file.
I went through the starter code to guide me as this is my first time making a webiste like this.
I hope to continue to learn and discover how to use new programming language.

There was certianly more that i wanted to add but due to bieng new at this I didnt want to mess it up.
This is no excuse as there is the whole wide web to learn how to code properly. 
I am happy with my results, I see growth in my skills, therefore I am proud of it and myself
