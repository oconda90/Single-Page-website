                    <p>
                        When I first started playing video games, I was very young. 
                        The first game I remember playing was the purple place games on windows making cakes and stuff; my sister and I would always fight to see who would use the computer.
                        While growing up, we had Nintendo products where we would play, Like on the DS or the Wii. 
                        One of my birthdays, one of my uncles, gave me a PlayStation 2, and the games were mature; one of the favorites I always played was Medal of Honor: the rising sun.
                        This game had a significant impact on my future gaming career. It was a world war 2 game, so it falls under the shooter type games, one of my main fortes now.

                        <h3>PlayStation</h3>
                        <p>
                            After our first PC started to malfunction, I had no other way to play games. My godfather was kind enough to give us a PlayStation. 
                            We didn't have too many games for the system. The game we played the most was Crash Bandicoot. 
                            A couple of years went by, and as I mentioned previously, we got a Playstation 2 with a lot more variety of games. 
                            Eventually, all of these consoles got outdated, but I couldn't keep getting newer consoles, so I continued to use my PlayStation 2 until the start of high school. 
                            For me, this wasn't really a problem. I was too young to really care honestly, but I did want to play games with friends as time went by.

                        <h3>Xbox</h3>
                        <p>
                            During the summer of my freshman year, I saved up enough money due to my recent birthday to get a new console.
                            When going to pick a console, I didn't really have any specific one on my mind. 
                            Since I was on a budget, I went with the more economically friendly price, which turned out to be an Xbox One. 
                            There was spare money, and since it didn't come with any other games, I bought Overwatch.
                            Little to my knowledge, this game became a huge stepping stone to what I would become today. 
                            Even since I started playing, I noticed the competitive game mode. I never played a game "competitively,"  so I found it really intriguing and fun. I spent a lot of time on my Xbox, too much time.

                        <h3>PC</h3>
                        <p>
                            In the summer of my junior year, I went to work with my mom at a flower nursery. 
                            I spent 2 months working outside. After a month working, I had enough money to buy me a somewhat decent pc, nothing too special.
                            The main game I still played was Overwatch; it was the only game I wanted to play, but I was at a considerable disadvantage. 
                            Most of the people already playing have been experienced with a keyboard and mouse.
                            When I first picked up the mouse and keyboard, I was in love since the aiming seemed to be more smooth and responsive. 
                            Even though this was true, I still couldn't snap on to targets and track smoothly like the experienced players. 
                            Now that I've been countlessly playing games climbing the rank ladder of Overwatch, I have achieved the rank of masters in a tank role.

                    <h2>Getting better</h2>
                    <p>
                        Since the beginning, I thought I was a hotshot when playing on my PlayStation 2. 
                        I had a reality check when I started middle school, and I would go over to a buddy's house and play Black ops 2 on his Xbox 360. 
                        He would absolutely obliterate me when playing against him; this got me frustrated, and I wanted to practice until I got better than him eventually. 
                        This couldn't be done since I didn't have a console that could play the game. 
                        When I got my Xbox, I only played Overwatch, and my buddy moved onto playing on the Playstation 4, so I never got my chance to go against him after having experience. 
                        I spent about 300+hours playing Overwatch in the entirety of gaming on the Xbox; although I wasn't the best, I had fallen in love with gaming. 
                        This made me continue to want to be better and grow in skill. 
                        Later Once again, this scenario happened but to a smaller degree. After playing on the Xbox for a while, then moving to PC, I had a rough start.

                        <h2>Moving up to PC</h2>
                        <p>
                        When I first got my PC, I didn't even have a desk. I would play on my dresser. I would have to pull a drawer, set a plywood piece, and put the keyboard and mouse on there. 
                        This wasn't optimal; after a while, my mom got me a desk, and my whole experience was changed. 
                        Learning the game mechanics was pretty simple but not being used to aiming with a mouse or moving with a keyboard was a small roadblock when I first started. 
                        I would continuously get destroyed by experienced players; I couldn't even fully enjoy the game. 
                        After hours and hours of playing and now it has been 2 years, I can proudly say I'm pretty skilled at aiming. 
                        I have accumulated over 600+ hours on PC overwatch and a couple hundred on Call Of Duty Modern Warfare. 
                        I would consider myself excellent and pro like at playing video games, but I'm proud of the things I can do now its been a crazy long journey to where I am now. 
                        This PC god gamer's journey has been put to a halt since I have school to focus on, but it won't hurt me from time to time to hop on COD and get called a cheater or a hacker. 
                        It's incredibly fun to hear people rage.
